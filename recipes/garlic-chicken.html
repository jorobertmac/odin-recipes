      <h2>Instructions</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Season chicken breasts with salt and pepper. Heat olive oil in a large
          skillet over medium-high heat. Sear chicken for 5-6 minutes on each
          side until golden brown and cooked through. Remove and set aside.
        </li>
        <li>
          Lower the heat, add butter to the skillet, and sauté garlic for 1
          minute. Add mushrooms and cook until softened (about 5 minutes).
        </li>
        <li>
          Stir in chicken broth, heavy cream, Parmesan, thyme, and parsley. Let
          simmer until the sauce thickens slightly (3-5 minutes).
        </li>
        <li>
          Return the chicken to the skillet, spoon the sauce over it, and let it
          simmer together for another 2 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
          Serve with your favorite side—great with fettuccine or a side of
          crusty bread!
